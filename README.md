# 🌿 MintBanshee | Web & App Development Student  

Hey there! I'm Lexy — aka **MintBanshee** — a curious soul on a coding adventure 💻✨  
I started my journey in May and I'm already diving deep into the magical world of design and development, one spell (or `git push`) at a time.

## 🎨 What I’ve Learned So Far
- 🧠 UI/UX Design (aesthetics + usability = 💖)
- 💻 Navigating the digital forest that is **Visual Studio Code**
- 🌙 Markdown magic (with help from my sidekick, Luna the AI!)

## ✨ Current Focus
- Learning front-end languages and tools  
- Building beautiful and functional projects  
- Organizing my life with custom folder icons (seriously, it’s a vibe)

## 🌸 Fun Facts
- I’m a stay-at-home mama by day, magical coder by night  
- I love cozy games, dreamy designs, and moonlit motivation  
- Favorite catchphrase: *“In the name of the moon, I’ll format you!”*
